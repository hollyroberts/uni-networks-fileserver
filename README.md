## Overview
A basic client/server architecture using sockets. Operations supported are: List files, upload file, download file, delete file. Failure scenarios are handled appropriately.

## Usage
Port 1234 is used by default and is hardcoded to the server. The client can change IP/port.

* Start the server (Server.class)
* Start the client (ClientGUI.class)
